# Grundfos-Project
Code for the Grundfos Project

This is a code for the info screen that could be located in the Grundfos Kollegiet in Aarhus that should serve its residents
by keeping them informed and creating a community.

We used HTML, CSS and a bit of JavaScript.

It's one of our first projects so there is plenty of room for improvement.
